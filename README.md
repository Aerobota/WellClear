WellClear
========

This repository includes definitions in Matlab of a family of
well-clear violation volumes and prototype implementations written in Java and
C++ of *DAIDALUS* (Detect and Aovid Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems).
*DAIDALUS* is a reference implementation of a detect and avoid concept
intended to support the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems into civil airspace.

For technical information about the definitions and algorithms in this
repository, visit [http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/cam/UAS_NAS](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/cam/UAS_NAS).
