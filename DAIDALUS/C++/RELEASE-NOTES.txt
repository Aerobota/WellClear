Release DAIDALUS 0.99, September 26, 2015  
---------------------
* Removed unused configuration parameters, e.g. time_delay,
recovery_bands_iff_ca_bands, etc.
* Removed dependency in Daidalus from Plans. This change allows  for
a simpler interface to add aircraft states.
* Added PVS output for validation purposes
* Added C++ interface to DAIDALUS
* Added missing get and setter methods to DAIDALUS

Release DAIDALUS 0.9a, July 26, 2015  
---------------------
* Fixed the null pointer exception caused by time synchronization problem.
* Changed preventive thresholds so that they use "strict less" instead of "less or equal".
* Supplied new configuration file that only contains parameters relevant to CASSAT 2.

Release DAIDALUS 0.9, July 17, 2015
--------------------- 
Added configuration parameters to alerting logic to set preventive thresholds.

Release DAIDALUS 0.d, June 1, 2015
--------------------- 
Added interface to turn off/off recovery bands. 

Release DAIDALUS 0.c, April 23, 2015
--------------------- 
Minor configuration changes.

Release DAIDALUS 0.b, April 7, 2015
--------------------- 
Included an alerting algorithm that incorporates recommendations from
attendants of the 2-day UAS Workshop held at NASA Langley Research
Center on March 26-27, 2015.

Release DAIDALUS 0.a, March 17, 2015
---------------------
Initial release of DAIDALUS interface. References to Chorus and
Stratway+ objects have been removed. DAIDALUS only depends on Util and
ACCoRD.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.4, February, 2015
--------------------------------
* Decoupled lookahead time and alert time. This adds a new parameter for
alert time. It also adds the ability to specify a base configuration
file.

* Improved stability of well-clear bands by adding a time
stabilization parameter.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3b, January, 2015
-------------------------------
Added interface methods for setting independent lookahead times for
conflict and well-clear bands.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3a, January, 2015
-------------------------------
Added conflict detection logic to be used in conjunction with
prevention bands logic in PT5 experiment.

Release Stratway+ 2.3.3, January, 2015
-------------------------------
* Added alerting logic and altitude bands interface to be used in PT5 experiment.

* Redesigned core architectural components of Stratway to support
integration of Well-Clear algorithms in the Appendix of RTCA SC 228
Detection and Avoid.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's well-clear alerting
concept.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's altitude bands concept.

* Implemented prototype interface of Stratway's well-clear recovery bands. Current
implementation supports strategies for selecting most urgent aircraft
based on DCPA and Time to Closest Point of Apporach (TCPA).

Release Stratway+ 1.8.4a, July, 2013
-------------------------------
* Modified interface to the TCAS prevention bands computed by Stratway+ to
enable different time and distance threshold tables for different aircraft.
* Initiated the development of prevention bands for flight levels. These
kinds of prevention bands indicate flight levels that are predicted to
be in conflict or cause a TCAS alert. In addition to aircraft state of
information (position and velocity vector information), the computation of
these bands require vertical acceleration and target rate of climb for the
ownship.

Release Stratway+ 1.8.3, April, 2013
-------------------------------
* Added table of time and distance thresholds for TCAS II Traffic
Alerts (TA).
* Added configurable TCAS II DMOD, TAU, ZTHR, and HMD threshold 
parameters.
* Added configurable on/off HMD filter for the TCAS II RA detection
logic.
* Added methods to access distance-based and TCAS-based conflict
information including most urgent conflict and for every conflict:
time to conflict, time out of conflict, and time of closest approach
(or time of minimum tau depending of configuration parameters).

February 21, 2013
--------------
Implemented a new interface to the TCAS-II RA detection code in
Stratway. The new interface will enable more sophisticated aircraft
kinematic models for predicting RAs and computing RA prevention bands.

December 5 2012
--------------
Developed a software interface in Stratway to support Langley's SSA
concept of integration. The software interface provides the following
functionality: creation of Stratway objects for onwnship and traffic
aircraft, setting of configurable parameters such as time delays,
lookahead times, and maximum aircraft performance values, checking if
an aircraft is well-clear for TCAS-II RAs, and computing kinematics
prevention bands for conflict-free areas in the airspace.
