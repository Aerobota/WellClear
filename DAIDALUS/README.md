DAIDALUS' Configurations
========

The directory `Configurations` includes the following DAIDALUS' configurations files
that are used in the current draft of RTCA SC-228 MOPS, i.e., V3.6
(2016-8-19):
* [`WC_SC_228_std.txt`](Contributions/WC_SC_228_std.txt): This
  configuration corresponds to the standard (unbuffered) definition of
  well-clear, where the alerting logic uses minimum average alerting
  time for preventive, corrective, and warning alerts, and  the
  maneuver guidance logic assumes instantaneous
  maneuvers. Furthermore, recovery bands saturate at violation of
  the cylinder defined by `DMOD` and `ZTHR`.
